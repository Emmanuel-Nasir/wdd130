        <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Nasir, I am from Ogun State, Nigeria. I am a student of BYU-IDAHO, I am currently studying software development. I am a technical support specialist and I really love coding so I decided to learn it. I enjoy anything that has to do with the computer system and music. I personally feels there is power in music just as there is in spoken words.</p>
